Analysis in Software Development 

1. The Analysis Phase in Software Development 

Definition & Importance The Analysis Phase (also called Requirements Analysis) is the second step in the SDLC, bridging planning and design. It ensures stakeholder needs are captured, documented, and validated before development begins. Importance: Prevents costly redesigns, aligns business goals, and sets a clear foundation for design and coding. 

Sub-Steps 

Requirement Gathering: Interviews, surveys, workshops with stakeholders. 

Feasibility Study: Technical, operational, and economic feasibility checks. 

Requirement Analysis: Categorizing functional vs. non-functional requirements. 

Modeling: Use cases, data flow diagrams, ER diagrams. 

Validation: Confirming requirements with stakeholders. 

Deliverables & Outcomes 

Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document 

Use case diagrams and process models 

Prioritized requirement list 

Risk analysis report 

Best Practices & Challenges 

Best Practices: Engage stakeholders early, document clearly, validate continuously. 

Challenges: Ambiguous requirements, scope creep, miscommunication.
